Code Review 

1. Name conventions + magic numbers
- the class name does not suggest the class scope 
- function name is not ok: 
-- name of the arguments 
--result variable to be renamed. value too

- delete/change hard-coded values from your code
- input data is not validated

2. single responsability + kiss for functions
- method calcultes too many intermediate values 
- some changes are repetitive
